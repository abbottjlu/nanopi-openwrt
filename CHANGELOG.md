The ttyd app works. 
Wiregaurd works. 
Deleted openclash stuff. 
The rest of them is the same as klever1988's config file for R2S mini. 

Failed to disable SSR. Now let it be. 
Add ttyd package and some TAR stuff. 



Fofked fro klever1988, then try to add wireguard, disable ssr. 
Wireguard works fine, as I have expected.
